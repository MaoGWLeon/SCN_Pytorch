# SMN_Pytorch

the PyTorch version for Sequential Matching Network~
<br>
<br>Sequential Matching Network(SMN) is a model of multi-turn conversation in retrieval-based chatbots. The model comes from the paperï¼š
[Wu, Yu, et al. "Sequential Matching Network: A New Archtechture for Multi-turn Response Selection in Retrieval-based Chatbots." ACL. 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01627v2.pdf)
<br>
<br>The author has opened [source code](https://github.com/MarkWuNLP/MultiTurnResponseSelection) .
He uses tensorflow and theano to implement Sequential Matching Network, if you use tensorflow or theano, 
you can use author's code directly.
<br>
<br>I implement Sequential Matching Network by **PyTorch**. 
Thanks for the tensorflow version for SMN, I learn a lot of details of the model.
